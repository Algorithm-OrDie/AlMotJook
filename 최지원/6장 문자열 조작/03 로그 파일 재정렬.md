[Reorder Data in Log Files - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-data-in-log-files/)

You are given an array of `logs`. Each log is a space-delimited string of words, where the first word is the **identifier**.

There are two types of logs:

- **Letter-logs**: All words (except the identifier) consist of lowercase English letters.
- **Digit-logs**: All words (except the identifier) consist of digits.

Reorder these logs so that:

1. The **letter-logs** come before all **digit-logs**.
2. The **letter-logs** are sorted lexicographically by their contents. If their contents are the same, then sort them lexicographically by their identifiers.
3. The **digit-logs** maintain their relative ordering.

Return *the final order of the logs*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]
Explanation:
The letter-log contents are all different, so their ordering is "art can", "art zero", "own kit dig".
The digit-logs have a relative order of "dig1 8 1 5 1", "dig2 3 6".
```

## ✍️ 풀이

```python
def reorderLogFiles(self, logs):
  answer = ""
  digit = []
  letter = []
  for i in logs:
      if i.split()[1].isdigit():
          digit.append(i)
      else:
          letter.append(i)
  
  letter.sort(key = lambda x: (x.split()[1:], x.split()[0]))
  answer = letter + digit
  return answer
```
