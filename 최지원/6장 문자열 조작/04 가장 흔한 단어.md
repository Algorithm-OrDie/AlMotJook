Given a string `paragraph` and a string array of the banned words `banned`, return *the most frequent word that is not banned*. It is **guaranteed** there is **at least one word** that is not banned, and that the answer is **unique**.

The words in `paragraph` are **case-insensitive** and the answer should be returned in **lowercase**.
